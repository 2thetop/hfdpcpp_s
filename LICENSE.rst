The original license remains same.

The Story from the book
-----------------------

Content from the book is copyrighted by the publisher O'Reilly Media of U.S and
Hanbit media of S. Korea.

Only the minimum bit of the book is introduced in this project under the
permission of the author, Elisabeth Robson. Any further release of the book must
be confirmed from the copy-right holders.

Minor wording fix or addition of some story from out of the book would be OK.
