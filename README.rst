**Origin** :
`Korean Translation of HFDP
<http://www.hanb.co.kr/book/look.html?isbn=89-7914-340-0>`_
`The Original Book <http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596007126.do>`_

**License** : The content of the Book is not a copy-left nor a open-source.
The story explained in the book is not shown explicitly on this project's
documentaion. Only some keyword or major core concepts are introduced under the
permission of one of the author, Elisabeth Robson.
Because this documentation can exist only with the author's permission, if
anyone wants to add more story from the book, it's not a good idea.

Eric T Freeman, Elisabeth Robson, Bert Bates, Kathy Sierra
